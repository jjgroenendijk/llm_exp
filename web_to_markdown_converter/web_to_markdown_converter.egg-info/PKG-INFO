# Web to Markdown Converter

This script converts a given website URL into Markdown format using `crawl4ai`.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://astral.sh/uv) (Python package and project manager)

If you don't have `uv`, you can install it by following the instructions on the official `uv` website (e.g., `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` or `pip install uv`).

## Setup

1. Clone this repository (or otherwise obtain the project files).
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd web_to_markdown_converter
   ```
3. Install dependencies and set up the environment using `uv`:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```
   This command will create a virtual environment (if one doesn't exist) and install the dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml`.

### Important Note on Playwright (First-time Setup)

`crawl4ai`, a core dependency of this project, uses Playwright for browser automation. If you are running this project for the first time or after a Playwright update, you might need to install the necessary browser binaries.

After running `uv sync` and before the first execution of the script, run the following command from within the `web_to_markdown_converter` project directory:

```bash
uv run playwright install
```

This will download and install the default browsers (like Chromium) that Playwright needs to operate. If you encounter errors related to missing browser executables when running the `convert` script, this step is usually the solution. The script itself will also try to detect if browsers are missing when you run it. If it detects this issue, it will print a message guiding you to run the `uv run playwright install` command.

## Usage

To convert a website to Markdown, run the following command from within the `web_to_markdown_converter` project directory:

```bash
uv run convert <URL>
```

Replace `<URL>` with the actual URL of the website you want to convert.

Example:
```bash
uv run convert https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/
```

The script will print the Markdown content to the console.

## Dependencies

- `crawl4ai`: For fetching and extracting website content, including direct Markdown conversion.

(Note: Initially, `markdownify` was considered as a fallback for HTML-to-Markdown conversion, but `crawl4ai`'s built-in capabilities appear sufficient for many cases.)
